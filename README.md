## Agile Methodology

### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. It is particularly effective in software development where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies aim to deliver small, incremental changes in a product to improve quality and adaptability to changing needs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is used to determine the importance of various features and tasks in a project. This method categorizes features into four groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This helps in effective time management and ensures that the most critical functionalities are delivered first. The recommended percentage of items is no more than 60% in Must, 20% in Should, and 20% in Could.

### GitHub Projects

Using GitHub Projects, tasks are managed and progress tracked through project boards. Three middle boards represent status of the User Story (To Do, In Progress, Done). First board displays EPICs and the last board displays issues that were labled as WON'T HAVE and are due to implement in future, along with discovered bugs. Each user story issue has labels that show the user story persona, MoSCoW priority category, order, Epic and iteration (milestone) it belongs to.

## UX/UI design

### Wireframe

The wireframes provide a visual representation of the layout and structure of the application. They outline the placement of key elements such as navigation menus, user profiles, content areas, and interactive features. The wireframes ensure a cohesive and intuitive user interface, guiding the design and development process. After the extensive testing was conducted, naturally there are some deviations from wireframes in the live version of the platform.

Tool: Balsamiq  
Format: PDF 

- [All Wireframes](./README-media/wireframes/winestore.pdf)
- [Base Template](./README-media/wireframes/base-template.pdf)
- [Home page](./README-media/wireframes/home.pdf)
- [About Us](./README-media/wireframes/about-us.pdf)
- [Contact Us](./README-media/wireframes/contact-us.pdf)
- [Shop Wine](./README-media/wireframes/shop-wine.pdf)
- [Promotions](./README-media/wireframes/promotions.pdf)
- [Product View](./README-media/wireframes/product-view.pdf)
- [Shopping Cart](./README-media/wireframes/cart.pdf)

### Structure & Logical Flow (database design)

The database schema describes the structure and relationships between the key tables of the platform. The User table stores basic user information and authentication data. The UserProfile table stores the default address, which allows the site to pre-populate the order delivery address for the user. The Order table stores all order details. The OrderLineItem table stores information about each bag line and makes it easy to calculate the total order value at checkout. The Product table stores all product information. It connects to several smaller tables such as Category, Variety, Vintage, Country, Brand, BottleSize. The Review table stores product reviews and ratings. Wishlist table stores the user's favourite products. The Coupon table stores the necessary information about the coupon and whether it has been used.

The database model diagram was designed using Lucidchart:

![Screenshot of flowchart](./README-media/database-diagram-pp5.png)

### Colour Scheme

The colours were mostly taken from bootstrap colour palette. They are:
- `#212529` - text colour 

Custom colours:
- `#e99767` - border accent colour 

![Custom colour palette](./README-media/)

### Typography

- **Rubik** was chosen as the primary font. Rubik is a sans serif font family with slightly rounded corners. It is a 5 weight family with Roman and Italic styles, that accompanies Rubik Mono One, a monospaced variation of the Black roman design. Rubik provides a friendly and approachable appearance while maintaining excellent readability on both screens and printed materials.

- **Alegreya Sans SC** was chosen as the primary title font. Alegreya Sans SC is a Small Caps companion family to Alegreya Sans, a humanist sans serif family with a calligraphic feeling that conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm. This gives a pleasant feeling to readers of long texts. The Alegreya type system is a "super family", originally intended for literature, and includes sans and serif sibling families. The family follows humanist proportions and principles, and achieves a ludic and harmonious paragraph through elements carefully designed in an atmosphere of diversity. The italics bring a strong emphasis to the roman styles.

- **Nunito** was chosen as the subtitle font. It is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily. Nunito was created as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography.

![Fonts](./README-media/fonts.png)


### Responsiveness

The website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport based on the Bootstrap media queries.

![media queries](./README-media/)

## Security Measures and Protective Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to ensure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions, ensuring users can only edit/delete content they authored. If the user doesn't pass the test, they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Password Management

- Use Django's built-in password management tools to ensure passwords are hashed and stored securely.
- Enforce strong password policies to enhance user account security.

### Form Validation

- If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit, and a warning will appear to the user informing them which field raised the error.

### Database Security

- The database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. This setup was implemented before the first push to GitHub.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used on all forms throughout the site to enhance security.

## Deployment

### AWS Cloud Service

Teacup Tales uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store static and media files securely in the cloud, ensuring fast and reliable access for our users.

**To integrate AWS, follow steps:**

#### **1. Create and Configure an S3 Bucket**

1.  **Access AWS:**
    
    -   Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your AWS Management Console.
2.  **Create an S3 Bucket:**
    
    -   Search for "S3" in the AWS Management Console and create a new bucket.
    -   Name the bucket to match your Heroku app name and select the region closest to your target audience.
3.  **Set Public Access and Ownership:**
    
    -   Uncheck the "Block all public access" option and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for compatibility with Heroku).
    -   Under "Object Ownership," ensure "ACLs enabled" and "Bucket owner preferred" are selected.
4.  **Enable Static Website Hosting:**
    
    -   In the "Properties" tab, enable static website hosting.
    -   Set `index.html` as the index document and `error.html` as the error document, then click "Save."
5.  **Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**
    
    -   In the "Permissions" tab, add the following CORS configuration:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    `[
      {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
    ]` 
    
    -   Copy your bucket's **ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).
6.  **Add a Bucket Policy:**
    
    -   Go to the "Bucket Policy" tab and click on the "Policy Generator" link.

### Stripe

Teacup Tales utilizes Stripe as its primary payment gateway to securely process e-commerce transactions. Stripe provides a reliable and scalable solution for handling payments, ensuring a seamless checkout experience for our customers.

#### **Steps for Stripe Integration:**

1.  **Create a Stripe Account:**
    
    -   Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account. Log in to your Stripe dashboard.
2.  **Obtain API Keys:**
    
    -   From your Stripe dashboard, locate the "API Keys" section under "Developers."
    -   Retrieve the following keys:
        -   **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY**: Your Publishable Key (starts with `pk`)
        -   **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Your Secret Key (starts with `sk`)
    -   These keys will be used to authenticate your application with Stripe.
3.  **Configure Webhooks for Payment Events:**
    
    -   To handle scenarios where a user may close the payment page prematurely, set up Stripe Webhooks to receive real-time payment updates.
    -   In your Stripe dashboard:
        -   Navigate to "Developers" and select "Webhooks."
        -   Click "Add Endpoint."
        -   Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://wine-shop.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`).
        -   Select "Receive all events" to capture all relevant payment events.
        -   Click "Add Endpoint" to complete the process.
    -   This will generate a new key:
        -   **STRIPE_WH_SECRET**: Your Webhook Signing Secret (starts with `wh`).

#### **Testing Stripe Payments:**

1.  **Test Mode:**
    
    -   Stripe provides a test mode to simulate payment transactions.
    -   Use the following test card details for interactive testing:
        -   **Card Number:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
        -   **Expiry Date:** Any valid future date (e.g., `12/34`)
        -   **CVC:** Any three-digit number (or four digits for American Express)
        -   **Other Fields:** Use any value for other fields.
2.  **Security Reminder:**
    
    -   Ensure all Stripe API keys and Webhook Signing Secrets are stored securely, and never hard-code them in your source code.

----------

***Summary:***

By integrating Stripe with Teacup Tales, we provide a secure and user-friendly payment solution. This setup will handle all e-commerce transactions, improve the user experience, and offer flexibility in managing payment events and ensuring payment security.
