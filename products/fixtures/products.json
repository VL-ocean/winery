The fruit is picked relatively early to preserve the natural vibrant acidity and lively fresh fruit character. Pinot Noir provides elegant red fruit flavors, a touch of color, and the wine’s delicate texture. Chardonnay is the perfect complement, adding structure and notes of stone fruit, cream, and apples. The blend was aged for eight years, adding complexity, and contributing an overall delicacy to the wine. The wine is then disgorged and a dosage is added back to balance the wine’s acidity. The resulting “méthode traditionnelle” sparkling wine showcases delicate bubbles, bright acidity, and beautifully layered flavors — a perfect addition to any celebration.",

The age of this wine results in layers of creaminess, balanced acidity, and an elegant sparkling crown with fine bubbles Serve chilled at 50-54° to accentuate the natural acidity.
